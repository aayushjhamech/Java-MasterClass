Java proctored assessment mock questions (samples for 10 marks question):

1. Create Solution class with main method. 
Read a number (without digits and non negative) using Scanner.
Program should print largest and smallest digit in that number (print output in separate lines).
Consider below sample input and output:

Input:
38729

Output:
9
2

2. Create Solution class with main method.
Read a String value using Scanner.
The program should print largest and smallest character (as per ASCII sqeuence) together. 
Consider below sample input and output (Output refers 'o' as largest and 'P' as smallest as we are following ASCII sequence):

Input:
Phone

Output:
oP

3. Create Solution class with main method. 
Read a String value using Scanner. 
The program should print the count of upper case and lower case alphabet characters in that String (print output in separate lines).
Consider below sample input and output:

Input:
DaTa#abC123

Output:
3
4

4.Create Solution class with main method. 
Read a String value using Scanner. 
The program should print sum of digits in that String. Input String may have non digit characters too, which should be ignored.
Consider below sample input and output:

Input:
DaTa#abC123ww

Output:
6

5. Write main method in Solution class.

The method will read a String value and print the minimum valued character (as per alphabet and ASCII sequence). 

Consider below sample input and output:

Input:

HellO

Output:

H

Important: Answer is not 'e' since 'H' has lower ASCII value then 'e'

6. Define main method in Solution class.

The program will read a String value. It will calculate total number of vowels in that string and print the answer.

Sample input:

internal

Output:

3
