Concept - Array Difficulty Level 1

Create a class Library with below attributes:

int - id

String - name

String - address

Make all the attributes private.Create corresponding getters and setters.

Create a constructor which takes all parameters in the above sequence. The constructor should set the value of attributes to parameter values inside the constructor.

Create a class LibraryDemo with main method

Create the below static method searchLibraryById in the LibraryDemo class.

searchLibraryById(Library[] objArray)

This method will take array of Library objects and id as input and returns the position of the id if found or -1 if not found.

Create an array of 5 Library objects in the main method
Refer below sample main method and test the output:

Call the above static method from the main method


public class LibraryDemo {
public static void main(String args[]){
Library library1= new Library(27,"vjxiyhc","kyoyfsl");
Library library2= new Library(34,"oguybhh","cuaxany");
Library library3= new Library(10,"oxhdjcs","gvhtlzw");
Library library4= new Library(19,"thamkrf","arijclh");
Library library5= new Library(32,"cvljyye","heijkiv");


Library[] objArray= {library1,library2,library3,library4,library5};

int libraryres= searchLibraryById(objArray, 59);
System.out.println("Output after first search: "+libraryres);

int libraryres1= searchLibraryById(objArray, 34);
System.out.println("Output after second search: "+libraryres1);
}}
Output
Output after first search: -1
Output after second search: 1
